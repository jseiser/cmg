# CMG 

Python Script to process text files and return status of instruments.  Helm Chart Included

### Tech

* [python](https://www.python.org/)
* [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
* [helm](https://helm.sh/)

### Pre-Req

Kubernetes Cluster
Helm Chart

Ideally, some sort of ingress but port-forward will work for POC

### Usage

```
cd chart/cmg
helm install cmg ./cmg-0.1.0.tgz
kubectl --namespace default port-forward service/cmg 8080:80

curl -X POST -F file=@data.txt http://localhost:8080/process
```

#### Results
```
{"hum-1":"Keep","hum-2":"Discard","temp-1":"Precise","temp-2":"Ultra Precise"}
```

Running Multiple Pods
```
‚ùØ kubectl get pods
NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cmg-7f5d76ddb9-ml6cv   1/1     Running   0          19s
cmg-7f5d76ddb9-pmdq2   1/1     Running   0          19s
```

## Things I wish I could change

1. Input file format is less than ideal.
2. Currently adding additional devices/rules requires editing the source code.  Would be preferable if data ingestion could be seperate from business rules.
3. No CI/CD Process is in place.  Would be nice to have time to configure Circle/Travis/Github Action to Spin up a KIND cluster, deploy the chart and verify it runs.
4. Helm Chart is not published.
5. No tests for python code.  Since I knew I wouldnt get to a CI process, I didnt see any point in spending my 4 hours on the tests.
6. No Infra code.  I only have access to AWS, and I didnt want to pay for the spend to spin up physical resources via TF.

## Adding additional Devices/Rules


Extend this function
```
# Each Devices needs a rule to return its status
def rule_validation(device_type, name, metrics, ref_temp, ref_humidity):
    """Determine Rules for Device types"""
    metrics = list(map(float, metrics))
    if device_type == "thermometer":
        return check_thermometer(metrics, ref_temp)
        
    elif device_type == "humidity":
        return check_humidity(metrics, ref_humidity)
```

Then add a custom validation function for that device type.

```
def check_something(metrics, ref_temp):
    return "Pass"
```
